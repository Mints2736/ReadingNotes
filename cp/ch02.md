#Chapter 2. Variables and Basic Types

##名不正言不顺

曾在 Stackoverflow 上 po 过[一个问题](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26711536/initializing-a-stdvector-from-a-count-and-an-element-value-with-copies)，引起了一些争论。也引起了我对于一些叫法的注意。

2.2.1. Variable Definitions 里面有一小节提了这个问题：
>Terminology: What is an Object?

>C++ programmers tend to be cavalier in their use of the term object. Most generally, an object is a region of memory that can contain data and has a type.

>Some use the term object only to refer to variables or values of class types. Others distinguish between named and unnamed objects, using the term variable to refer to named objects. Still others distinguish between objects and values, using the term object for data that can be changed by the program and the term value for data that are read-only.

>In this book, we’ll follow the more general usage that an object is a region of memory that has a type. We will freely use the term object regardless of whether the object has built-in or class type, is named or unnamed, or can be read or written.

**对象**：一段内存，type + data；
- 习惯一：管**类**的变量或值才叫对象。(这也是我们通常所理解的)
- 习惯二：区分**有名对象**与**无名对象**，管前者叫变量(variable)。
- 习惯三：区分**对象**与**值**，前者是程序里可以改变的数据，后者是只读数据(也就是**字面量**)。

遵从上述叫法习惯，更利于沟通。
